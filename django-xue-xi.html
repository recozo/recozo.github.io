<dd>A Django view is where most of the logic for your application is
defined. A view is a function that you write that will receive
a request in the form of a Python object (specifically, a Django
HttpRequest object).Your view must return an HttpResponse object
that encapsulates all the information being provided to the client.</dd>

<h3>GET, POST, and QueryDict Objects</h3>
<p>Django automatically parses these parameter strings into QueryDict objects.
The data is then available on the HttpRequest object that is passed to your
view—specifically, in the HttpRequest.GET and HttpRequest.POST attributes,
for URL parameters and body parameters respectively. QueryDict objects are
objects that mostly behave like dictionaries, except that they can contain
multiple values for a key. Code snippets</p>

<div class="section" id="exploring-django-settings">
<h3>Exploring Django Settings</h3>
<p>Django has more settings available that aren't listed in the settings.py file,
and so it will use its built-in defaults in these cases. You can also use the
file to set arbitrary settings that you make up for your application.
Third-party applications might want settings to be added here as well.</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
from django.conf import settings # import settings from here instead

    do_some_logging()

<p>When importing settings from django.conf, Django mitigates the three issues
we just discussed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Settings are read from whatever Django settings file has been specified.</li>
<li>Any default settings values are interpolated.</li>
<li>Django takes care of parsing any settings defined by a third-party library.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="finding-html-templates-in-app-directories">

<div class="section" id="rendering-a-template-with-the-render-function">
<h3>Rendering a Template with the render Function</h3>
<p>render takes at least two arguments: the first is always the request that was
passed to the view, and the second is the name/relative path of the template
being rendered. We will also call it with a third argument, the render context
that contains all the variables that will be available in the template</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rendering-variables-in-templates">
<h3>Rendering Variables in Templates</h3>
<p>To render a variable in a template, simply wrap it with braces: {{ book_name }}.
Django will automatically escape HTML in output so that you can include special
characters (such as &lt; or &gt;) in your variable without worrying about it garbling
your output. If a variable is not passed to a template, Django will simply render
nothing at that location, instead of throwing an exception.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This chapter was a quick introduction to Django. You first got up to speed on the
HTTP protocol and the structure of HTTP requests and responses. We then saw how
Django uses the MVT paradigm, and then how it parses a URL, generates an HTTP request,
and sends it to a view to get an HTTP response. We scaffolded the Bookr project
and then created the reviews app for it. We then built two example views to illustrate
how to get data from a request and use it when rendering templates. You should have
experimented to see how Django escapes output in HTML when rendering a template.</p>

<div class="section" id="database-configuration-and-creating-django-applications">
<h3>Database Configuration and Creating Django Applications</h3>
</div>
<div class="section" id="django-apps-1">
<h3>Django Apps</h3>
<p>A Django project can have multiple apps that often act as discrete entities.
That's why, whenever required, an app can be plugged into a different Django project as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="django-migration">
<h3>Django Migration</h3>
<p>the transformation of Python code into database structures is known as migration.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python manage.py migrate
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-django-models-and-migrations">
<h3>Creating Django Models and Migrations</h3>
<p>A Django model is essentially a Python class that holds the blueprint
for creating a table in a database. The models.py file can have many such models,
and each model transforms into a database table. The attributes of the class form
the fields and relationships of the database table as per the model definitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="field-types">
<h3>Field Types</h3>
</div>
<div class="section" id="field-options">
<h3>Field Options</h3>
<p>Django has many more field types and field options that can be explored from the extensive
official Django documentation. Execute the following command in the shell or terminal to
migrate the Django models into the database</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python manage.py makemigrations appname
</pre>
<p>The makemigrations &lt;appname&gt; command creates the migration scripts for the given app;
When we run makemigrations without the app name, the migration scripts will be created
for all the apps in the project. The following command, when run in the shell or terminal,
will show the status of model migrations throughout the project</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python manage.py showmigrations
</pre>
<p>Next, let's understand how Django transforms a model into an actual database table</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python manage.py sqlmigrate appname migrationscript
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="primary-keys">
<h3>Primary Keys</h3>
<p>Since the migration script has already been created by executing makemigrations,
let's now migrate the newly created model in the app by executing the following command</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python manage.py migrate app
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relationships">
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Many to One</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
</pre>
<p>Many to Many</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
contributors = models.ManyToManyField('Contributor', through='BookContributor')
</pre>
<p>through: This is a special field option for many-to-many relationships. When we
have a many-to-many relationship across two tables, if we want to store some extra
information about the relationship, then we can use this to establish the relationship
via an intermediary table. When the through field option is not provided while
establishing a many-to-many relationship, Django automatically creates an intermediary
table to manage the relationship.</p>
<p>One-to-One Relationships</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
person = models.OneToOneField(Person, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="model-methods">
<h3>Model Methods</h3>
<p>In Django, we can write methods inside a model class. These are called model methods and
they can be custom methods or special methods that override the default methods of Django models.
One such method is __str__(). This method returns the string representation of the Model instances
and can be especially useful while using the Django shell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="django-s-database-crud-operations">
<h3>Django's Database CRUD Operations</h3>
<p>To execute the CRUD operations, we will enter Django's command-line shell
by executing the following command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python manage.py shell
</pre>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Exercise 2.02: Creating an Entry in the Bookr Database</dt>
<dd>In this exercise, you created an entry in the database by creating an instance of the model object
and used the save() method to write the model object into the database. the changes(update) to the
class instance are not saved until the save() method is called.</dd>
<dt>Exercise 2.03: Using the create() Method to Create an Entry</dt>
<dd>Invoke the create() method to create an object in the database in a single step.
Ensure that you pass all the required parameters</dd>
<dt>Exercise 2.04: Creating Records for a Many-to-One Relationship</dt>
<dd>In this exercise, we learned that while creating a database record, an object can be assigned to
a field if it is a foreign key.</dd>
<dt>Exercise 2.05: Creating Records with Many-to-Many Relationships</dt>
<dd>use the relationship to create the objects, we can use through_default to pass
in a dictionary with the parameters defining the required fields.</dd>
<dt>Exercise 2.07: Using the get() Method to Retrieve an Object</dt>
<dd>In this exercise, we learned how to fetch a single object using the get() method.
There are several disadvantages to using this method, though. It is important to
note that the get() method can only fetch one object. If there is another object
carrying the same value as the field mentioned, then we can expect a 'returned
more than one' error message. We can also get a 'matching query does not exist'
error message when there are no objects returned from the get() query. The get()
method can be used with any of the object's fields to retrieve a record.</dd>
<dt>Exercise 2.08: Using the all() Method to Retrieve a Set of Objects</dt>
<dd>In this exercise, we learned how to retrieve all the objects using the all() method
and we also learned how to use the retrieved set of objects as a list.</dd>
<dt>Exercise 2.09: Using the filter() Method to Retrieve Objects</dt>
<dd><p class="first">In this exercise, we saw the use of filters to retrieve a set of a few objects
filtered by a certain condition.  Now, let's suppose we want to filter and query
a set of objects using the object's fields by providing certain conditions. In such
a case, we can use what is called a double-underscore lookup( __gt, __gte,  __lt, __lte,
__contains, __icontains, __startswith, etc).</p>
<p>we can use the exclude() method to exclude a certain condition and fetch all the required objects.</p>
<p>We can retrieve a list of objects while ordering by a specified field, using the order_by() method.
We can also use a prefix with the negative sign for the field parameter to order results
in descending order.</p>
<p class="last">Yet another useful method offered by Django is values(). It helps us get a query set of
dictionaries instead of objects.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now let's study how to perform queries across relationships. There are several ways
to go about this, such as Querying Using Foreign Keys, Querying Using Model Name
(written in lowercase) , Querying Across Foreign Key Relationships Using the Object Instance.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Exercise 2.10: Querying Across a Many-to-Many Relationship Using Field Lookup</dt>
<dd>In this exercise, we learned how to perform queries across many-to-many relationships
using field lookup.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Exercise 2.11: A Many-to-Many Query Using Objects</p>
<p>Exercise 2.12: A Many-to-Many Query Using the set() Method</p>
<p>Exercise 2.13: Using the update() Method</p>
<p>Exercise 2.14: Using the delete() Method</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary-1">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>we learned about Django models, migrations, and how they help propagate the changes
to the Django models in the database.</p>
<p>We shored up our knowledge of databases by learning about database relationships,
and their key types, in relational databases.  We also worked with the Django shell,
where we used Python code to perform the same CRUD queries we performed earlier using SQL.
Later, we learned how to retrieve our data in a more refined manner using pattern matching
and field lookups.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we saw how to create superusers through the Django command line
and how to use them to access the admin app. After a brief tour of the admin app's
basic functionality, we examined how to register our models with it to produce a
CRUD interface for our data.</p>
<p>Then we learned how to refine this interface by modifying site-wide features. We
altered how the admin app presents model data to the user by registering custom
model admin classes with the admin site. This allowed us to make fine-grained
changes to the representation of our models' interfaces. These modifications
included customizing change list pages by adding additional columns, filters,
date hierarchies, and search bars. We also modified the layout of the model admin pages
by grouping and excluding fields.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="serving-static-files">
<h2>5. Serving Static Files</h2>
<p>Django provides tools for serving static assets with its development server
during development. When your application goes to production, it can also
collect all your assets and copy them to a folder for a dedicated web server
to host. This allows you to keep your static files segregated in a meaningful way
during development and automatically bundle them for deployment.</p>
<p>This functionality is provided by Django's built-in staticfiles app. It adds
several useful features for working with and serving static files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The static template tag to automatically build the static URL for an asset and
include it in your HTML.</li>
<li>A view (called static) that serves static files in development.</li>
<li>Static file finders to customize where assets are found on your filesystem.</li>
<li>The collectstatic management command, which finds all static files and moves
them into a single directory for deployment.</li>
<li>The findstatic management command, which shows which static file on disk is
loaded for a particular request. This also helps to debug if a particular file
is not being loaded.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="forms">
<h2>6. Forms</h2>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-form">
<h3>What is a form?</h3>
<p>A form is made up of inputs that define key-value pairs of data to submit to the server.
Each input in the form has a name, and this is how its data is identified on the server-side
(in a Django view). There can be multiple inputs with the same name, whose data is available
in a list containing all the posted values with this name.</p>
<p>FORM SECURITY WITH CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY PROTECTION</p>
<p>The CSRF token must be added into the HTML for every form being sent and is done with
the {% csrf_token %} template tag. The CSRF token is unique to every visitor on the site
and periodically changes.</p>
<p>ACCESSING DATA IN THE VIEW</p>
<p>These are request.GET , which contains parameters passed in the URL, and request.POST ,
which contains parameters in the HTTP request body.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All values are sent as text, even number and date inputs.</li>
<li>For the select inputs, the selected value attributes of the selected options are sent,
not the text content of the option tag.</li>
<li>If you select multiple options for books_you_own , then you will see multiple values
in the request. This is why we use the getlist method since multiple values are sent
for the same input name.</li>
<li>If the checkbox was checked, you will have a checkbox_on input in the debug output.
If it was not checked, then the key will not exist at all (that is, there is no key,
instead of having the key existing with an empty string or None value).</li>
<li>We have a value for the name submit_input , which is the text Submit Input . You submitted
the form by clicking the Submit Input button, so we receive its value. Notice that no value
is set for the button_element input since that button was not clicked.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHOOSING BETWEEN GET AND POST</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The most important is deciding whether or not the request should be idempotent.</li>
<li>Another point to consider is that Django only applies CSRF projection to POST requests.</li>
<li>If sending form data with a GET request, the form parameters will be visible in the URL.</li>
<li>the maximum length of a URL allowed by a browser can be short compared to the size of
a POST body – sometimes only around 2,000 characters (or about 2 KB) compared to
many megabytes or gigabytes that a POST body can be</li>
</ul>
<p>WHY USE GET WHEN WE CAN PUT PARAMETERS IN THE URL?</p>
<p>THE DJANGO FORMS LIBRARY</p>
<p>The Django Forms library allows you to quickly define a form using a Python class.
This is done by creating a subclass of the base Django Form class. You can then use
an instance of this class to render the form in your template and validate the input
data.</p>
<p>DEFINING A FORM</p>
<p>You define a class that inherits from the django.forms.Form class. The class has
attributes, which are instances of different django.forms.Field subclasses.</p>
<p>When rendered, the attribute name in the class corresponds to its input name in HTML.
To give you a quick idea of what fields there are, some examples are CharField ,
IntegerField , BooleanField , ChoiceField , and DateField . Each field
generally corresponds to one input when rendered in HTML, but there's not always
a one-to-one mapping between a form field class and an input type. Form fields are
more coupled to the type of data they collect rather than how they are displayed.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, consider a text input and a password input. They both accept
some typed-in text data, but the main difference between them is that the text
is visibly displayed in a text input, whereas with a password input the text is
obscured. In a Django form, both of these fields are represented using CharField .
The difference in how they are displayed is set by changing the widget the
field is using.</p>
<p>Django defines a number of Widget classes that define how a Field should be
rendered as HTML. They inherit from django.forms.widgets.Widget . A
widget can be passed to the Field constructor to change how it is rendered.</p>
<p>RENDERING A FORM IN A TEMPLATE</p>
<p>Django does not add the &lt;form&gt; element or submit button(s) for you when
rendering the template; you should add these around where your form is placed in
the template. The form can be rendered like any other variable.</p>
<p>VALIDATING FORMS AND RETRIEVING PYTHON VALUES</p>
<p>We will now look at the other part of what makes Django forms useful:
their ability to automatically validate the form and then retrieve native Python objects
and values from them.</p>
<p>In Django, a form can either be unbound or bound. These terms describe whether or
not the form has had the submitted POST data sent to it for validation.A form is bound
if it is called with some data to be used for validation, such as the POST data.
A bound form allows us to start using built-in validation-related tools:
first, the is_valid method to check the form's validity, then the cleaned_data attribute
on the form, which contains the values converted from strings to Python objects.</p>
<p>The cleaned_data attribute is only available after the form has been cleaned,
which means the process of &quot;cleaning up&quot; the data and converting it from strings to
Python objects. The cleaning process runs during the is_valid call. You will get
AttributeError raised if you try to access cleaned_data before calling is_valid .</p>
<p>note that unlike when we iterated over all of the POST data, cleaned_data only
contains form fields. The other data (such as the CSRF token and the submit button
that was clicked) is present in the POST QueryDict but is not included as
it does not include form fields.</p>
<p>BUILD-IN FIELD VALIDATION</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>This chapter was an introduction to forms in Django. We introduced some HTML
inputs for entering data onto a web page. We talked about how data is submitted
to a web application and when to use GET and POST requests. We then looked at
how Django's form classes can make generating the form HTML simpler, as well as
allowing the automatic building of forms using models.</p>
